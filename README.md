Debloat Windows 11/10

This project aims to help users stop/minimize the amount of data that Windows 11 and Windows 10 will send back to Microsoft. The project also helps to reduce internet usage caused by Windows's background tasks. Multiple scripts are provided with each script doing different things, like just privacy and security fixes or removal of bloatware apps. 


Disclaimer: Before running the scripts, it is recommended to read through and make changes based on your needs. Everyone prefers different settings, and it may be a pain later on to fix issues or change a setting back when you notice. I built this from multiple different debloat scripts found on GitHub and credit is given where needed.


All suggestions are welcome, and you can create a pull request if wanted. Otherwise, if you have issues, create a new issue in the issues section and I will take a look.
